    summary: |
      Mother - Educator - Lifelong Learner - UX Designer - and now Frontend Developer.  
      After feeling stagnant in my teaching career, I decided to invest in myself and 
      enrolled in a UX/UI Design bootcamp in Miami.  Once there, the flood gates opened
      to all the possibilities that the tech world encompassed.  What I realized through my
      first role is that my prior experiences primed me for this chapter, where I have been
      able to fuse the years of problem solving, planning, strategizing, and executing experience
      in order to design delightful experiences.  And now, I can take it a step further and now
      build those experiences myself.
