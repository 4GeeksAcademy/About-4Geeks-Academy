    summary: |
      Mother - Educator - Lifelong Learner - UX Designer - and now Frontend Developer.  
      After feeling stagnant in my teaching career, I decided to invest in myself and 
      enrolled at a UX/UI Design bootcamp in Miami.  Once there, the flood gates opened
      to all the possibilities that the tech world provided.  What I realized through my
      first role is that my prior experiences as an educator primed me for this chapter, 
      where I have been able to fuse the years of problem solving, planning, strategizing, 
      and executing in order to design delightful experiences.  And now, I can take it a 
      step further and now build those experiences myself.
