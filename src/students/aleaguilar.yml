        At REIC we serve the Latin American firefighter industry, providing expert advice and procurement on leading safety gear for first responders.

        Our relationship with leading manufacturers of equipment allows us to bring a vast array of products into a market that has tremendous challenges. Latin America as a whole has always been an interesting market for any brand, however, the difference between countries, legislation, and economic realities make it a challenge to effectively develop commercial relationships.

        We are focused on changing how business is conducted in the region, by promoting cross-collaboration to lower end-user costs and entry barriers.

        We aim to work with manufacturers to further expand their markets and provide first responders with the quality of product and safety they deserve.
