    summary: |
        I am currently a college student who is aiming to shape a career in technology. 
        Excited to implement my capabilities and collaborate with my future colleagues
        in projects that create a positive impact amongst and around us. I am self-driven
        by a curious mind, which always leads me to find new interests and learn about better 
        ways to solve problems in diverse scenarios.

        I code in Java, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like Spring Boot with Hibernate for 
        Web Development projects. I also have good comprehension of different tools like NetBeans,
        IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code, and Github. I have worked with Figma Software for graphic interface design,
         Adobe Photoshop, and Illustrator.
