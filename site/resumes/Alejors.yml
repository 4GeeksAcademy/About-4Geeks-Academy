    summary: |
      I studied Veterinary Medicine. Worked a couple of years and realized I needed something else to achieve my
      personal goals. Made some changes in my life, worked abroad for some months and came back to work in a bank 
      for a year. After this became a flight attendant for LATAM airlines for 4 years. All across these backs and 
      forths I always loved every task where I was challenged to solve problems and work in different interfaces.

      That was the moment I began researching about coding. Began learning with HarvardX CS 50 and the Odin's Project,
      and after this I heard about 4GeeksAcademy and enrolled myself to a full-time bootcamp to become a Full-stack developer.

      details: |
        Received regular consults on weekends. Also cared for hospitalized patients during night shifts and received
        emergencies. Had to work underpressure when patients were in need of immediate surgeries or procedures, and
        assemble teams to solve crises as fast as possible.
        The main challenge was to realize procedures autonomously when an emergency came up, and challenge myself to 
        use any means possible to save a pet's life. 

    - role: Account executive
      time: 2014 - 2015
      company: Banco Santander, Chile

      details: |
        As an account executive had to solve my clients requests as fast as possible, advise them on the best options 
        for the projects they had in mind, sell products the bank was offering, such as new accounts, loans, insurances or investments.
        Solving clients' requests was always challenging, and needed much team work.
    
    - role: Flight-attendant
      time: 2016 - 2010
      company: LATAM Airlines, Chile

      details: |
        As a flight-attendant I was asked to work in rotative teams, which changed on each flight. During each flight
        a flight-attendant cares for in-flight safety procedures and attends to passengers' needs.
        On every flight there is a hierarchy in your team, and everyone has his own tasks, but everyone also has to care
        for every procedure to be thoroughly checked to have a safe flight.
        This role challenges you to work in different teams, with colleagues of different backgrounds and nationalities.
        Therefore you need to adapt every time to solve different kind of problems.
