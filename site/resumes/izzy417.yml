#summary
summary: Hello, my name is Israel Dail and I am learning to program. I have always been interested in computers and finally decided that I NEED to pick up on a technical skill. So I am going with programming, I am starting off with the full-stack program but I don't plan on stopping there in terms of learning. I want to learn all facets of programming little by little.
