      I am always seeking for new challenges, projects and opportunities, that's why I reinvent myself multiple times and focus my career towards my big passion, travelling. Currently, I'm studying at 4Geeks to become a full-stack web developer.
      
      Moreover, I am Business Administration graduate specialised in social media and content creation with over 5 years experience. I have developed my own Instagram brand with almost 30,000 followers so far (@eliana_jordan).

      On the other hand, talking about my hobbies, besides of travelling and discovering other cultures, I love scuba diving, what it took me to become scuba diving instructor at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia to share my passion with others. I practice surf, skate, climbing, yoga and a little bit of kitesurf as well.
