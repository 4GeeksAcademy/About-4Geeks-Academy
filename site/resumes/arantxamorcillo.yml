    summary: |
      My name is Arantxa Morcillo, I have six years of experience in design. I moved to London to study Fashion Design. When I finished my BA Honours in Fashion Design, and after very successful job experiences in fashion studios, I embarked myself on a personal research project. I traveled along the Panamerican Highwats studying, learning and breathing the wealth of Latin American cultures and landscapes.

      In 2015, I moved back to Madrid and I launched my own fashion studio. We developed three full runway collections displayed on international catwalks (London, Vancouver, Alicante) and we also designed custom haute couture for women. We stood up for finding a balance between aesthetics and comfort, our clients' needs being our top priority, they needed to feel great to look great.

      After three years of running my fashion studio, I enrolled on the post-graduate UX program at La Nave Nodriza. I finished the program having worked on three main projects. I would like to drive your attention to my final project, TU PARTO, focusing on womenâ€™s wellbeing.Here my goal was to guarantee that women do not suffer Obstetric Violence.
