      details: |
        I studied Civil Enginnering for 1 semester, which is equivalent to 6 months in Brazil. That was the first time I had experience with coding, because one of my classes was "computer programming", and I learned C++. I had other classes like Chemistry, Algebra and Analitic Geometry, and Introduction to Engineering.
