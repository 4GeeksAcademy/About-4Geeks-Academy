    summary: |
      As a recent graduate mechanical engineer, I have been programming for six years in an educational context, employing several languages, some of which are self-taught. 
      Given my passion for programming, I am seeking a job or an entry-level position as a backend frontend to full-stack developer in a company where my attention to detail and eagerness to learn are valued.
