    summary: |
      After a long period of flirting with the humanities and the arts, I have discovered a passion that integrates
      very well with my personality: web development. Currently absorbing the entire spectrum, from design to architecture
      and implementation of systems. Willing to work in a company or project that gives me meaning and allows me to continue learning.
