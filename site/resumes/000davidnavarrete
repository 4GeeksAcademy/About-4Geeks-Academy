    summary: |
      I was always interested in IT, I had studied Python, HTML and CSS on my own, although I was always working as a locksmith, because it's the family business and it's what was expected of me. 
      Come 2021, I decided it was time to work on what I always wanted and started training on Codecademy and Udemy: in Python and GIT. 
      In 2022, I contacted 4Geeks Academy and learned with them the rest of the skills I needed to become a web developer. 
      I am currently a full-stack web developer, specifically, I am more attracted to front-end development, although I am passionate about the whole world of software development, and I do not rule out that my degree of interest between the different fields, may vary during my career in this world.
