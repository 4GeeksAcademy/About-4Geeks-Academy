    summary: |
      I began taking interest on programming around 9th grade when I realized the amount of cool things you could do creating code, 
      I took various courses (of basic level) of programming and I learned the basics of Javascript, so far I haved worked on a small company as an intern,
      helping with th front and the backend, and in another company where I was assigned with the creating of programs that could render 3d models on a three-dimensional
      environment.
