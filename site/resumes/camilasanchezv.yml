# Your project portfolio

    intro: >
      Have a lot of projects at my github account, but i'll share the biggest (and public) one of them, an administration app for a Car Rental.
      The code is private by the moment, but this is an old public copy of the project I made for sharing.

      Also another simplier project I have, is a React.js basic Spreadsheet I did for a job interview, int actually really small and did it in a couple of days,
      but wanted to include because it really shows my react knowledge.
