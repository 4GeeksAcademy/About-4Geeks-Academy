    summary: |
      I am an IT professional with over 4 years of experience. I started my
      IT career since I was very young because I have been interested on
      it since I was a kid. I face challenges as new opportunities to grow
      and use my experience to help others grow as well.

      I feel very passionate about learning new things and like to
      understand things from their very foundations. When I don't
      understand or don't know how to do something I like to investigate
      and study whatever is needed to succeed on implementing that
      task.

      I take projects and tasks with care as if they were my own and I am
      always looking for the opportunity of taking a weakness and
      convert it into a strength without loosing the focus, dedication and
      most importantly keeping the joy of doing what I do every day.
