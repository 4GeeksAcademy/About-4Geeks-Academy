    summary: |
      I have an important basic training in computer science thanks to the studies
      at the Faculty of Computer Science of Barcelona. Later, I studied a Bachelor
      of Philosophy from UNED. Training in so many different fields allows me to have
      a broad vision of reality, which I think can be useful in the field of programming.
      It's a task that I'm passionate about and that is why I want to dedicate myself to it.

        The Degree Plan in Philosophy seeks to transmit the important inheritance of knowledge acquired
        by philosophical thought, introduce the student to the issues addressed by it, present them with current
        affairs and actively initiate them in the formation of their own philosophical reflection.
        This is intended to provide students with sufficient knowledge of philosophical methods that allow them
        to critically approach texts and problems on their own and that they know how to deal with sources
        and with the bibliography search and selection instruments that at any given time specify.
        The student must show the capacity for dialogue and understanding of the various arguments,
        analysis and reflection.
