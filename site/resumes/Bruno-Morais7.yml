    summary: |
      Sport is a big part of my life. Helped to get the confidance I never had. 
      I persued the carrer as a coach and a teacher... it was quite a good one. 
      But there was always something missing... 
      The love for developing the passion to persue the creation in the digital world.
      Now it is time to learn and make it happen. Just keep coding!
