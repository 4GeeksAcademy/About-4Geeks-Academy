      details: I pursued my degree part-time, during which I honed my skills in data management and analysis, and gained a deep understanding of governmental operations and public policies. I'm currently working on my thesis, which focuses on analyzing the process of Decentralization in Uruguay, particularly the role that the Congress of Intendants has played in this process. |
